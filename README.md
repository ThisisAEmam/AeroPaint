## AeroPaint

Welcome to AeroPaint.

## What is AeroPaint:

In our project, the main goal is to make the drawing on computer easier. While drawing with
the mouse could be hard and frustrating, we aim to make use of the modern image processing
and Computer Vision techniques in order to give the users the capability to draw with their
hands in the air and see their drawings appear simultaneously as they draw.

## How AeroPaint work:

1. We run our app through the main.py file (AeroPaint/AeroPaint/main.py).

2. Our app consists of tow pages the first page have just a button that says start drawing
   press on it to go to the other window and activate your camera.

3. In our main window (the drawing window) it contains two regions the toolbar at the top
   and the drawing area.

4. The toolbar contains three modes the brush to draw the eraser and the bucket to fill your
   shapes with color and the colors to choose from.

5. In the beginning you raise your hand so it can be detected then you can choose the mode 
   just by hovering with your index finger over for examble the brush to draw then you choose
   the drawing color.

6. You can start drawing by rising your index finger and close the rest of your hand and then
   you can draw.

7. We support the refinig of three shapes (circle, square, triangle) if you draw a circle and
   you want to refine it you just do thumbs up and it will be refined automatically.
